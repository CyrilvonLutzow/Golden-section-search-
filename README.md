# Golden-section-search c#

The golden section search is a technique for finding the maximum of a strictly unimodal function by successively narrowing the range of values inside which the extremum is known to exist. 
The technique derives its name from the fact that the algorithm maintains the function values for triples of points whose distances form a golden ratio.
